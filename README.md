# Today I Learned (TIL)

This repository is a **collection of short, daily learnings and insights** I've gained throughout my learning journey. Each entry represents a valuable nugget of knowledge or a practical tip related to various topics.

## Public Learning

I strongly believe in the power of **Public Learning**, which embraces the practice of openly sharing and documenting one's learning journey on public platforms. 

By exposing oneself to vulnerability and actively engaging with the community through mediums like GitHub, chats, study programs, and more, **we contribute to a culture of collective growth and knowledge sharing**. This TIL repository is a testament to my commitment to practicing and embracing Public Learning, where I aim to inspire others, receive feedback, and foster collaboration within the wider learning community.
