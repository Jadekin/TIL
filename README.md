# TIL - Today I Learned

This is a small repo with small projects of topics that I am currently learning. I would love to have a blog, but I have to say that I am not persistent enough for that. Maybe, this small (and atomic) intent is easier to follow. 

I saw this idea in [Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) repo and I really loved it. I think It really embrace the value of being a constant learner.
